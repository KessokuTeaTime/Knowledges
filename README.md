# Knowledges

**Knowledges** makes inspecting game information such as block, entity and armor durability easier and more elegent than ever. **Knowledges** provides fully extensionable component and data api that can be easily added through your mod's entrypoints.

By default, **Knowledges** provides 6 components:

- **Crosshair**  
  <sup>Displays an oval around the crosshair when focusing something, also for displaying progressed information like **block breaking progress** and **entity health.**</sup>
- **Info**  
  <sup>Displays informational texts.</sup>
  - **Block Info**  
    <sup>Displays block information near the crosshair, including **block name** and **block breaking progress.**</sup>
  - **Entity Info**  
    <sup>Displays entity information near the crosshair, including **entity name,** **entity type *through color*** and **entity health.**</sup>
  - **Fluid Info**  
    <sup>Displays fluid information near the crosshair, including **fluid volume.**</sup>
- **Armor Durability**  
  <sup>Displays **armor durability *through color*** at the bottom right of the screen.</sup>

...and countless of data.

**Knowledges** works well with **Mod Menu** and **Cloth Config API,** so you can easily configure the above by installing the two mods.
