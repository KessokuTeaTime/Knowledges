# Knowledges

**Knowledges** make inspecting game information such as block, entity and armor durability easy and elegent. We provide fully extensionable components that can be added through mod's entrypoints, and simple api for every developer to use.

By default, we provide 4 knowledge:

- Crosshair  
  <sup>Displays an oval around the crosshair when focusing something, also for displaying progressed information like **block breaking progress** and **entity health.**</sup>
- Block Info  
  <sup>Displays block information near the crosshair, such as **block name** and **block breaking progress.**</sup>
- Entity Info  
  <sup>Displays entity information near the crosshair, such as **entity name,** **entity type *through color*** and **entity health.**</sup>
- Armor Durability  
  <sup>Displays **armor durability *through color*** at the bottom right of the screen.</sup>

**Knowledges** works well with **Mod Menu** and **Cloth Config API,** so you can easily configure the above by installing the two mods.
